# Odin

Odin is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Odin makes it easier to manage software development courses using a combination of [Blackboard eLearning platform](https://www.blackboard.com/en-eu) and the [GitLab DevOps platform](https://about.gitlab.com/). 

Odin has been designed and developed by [Petter Gr√∏ Rein](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/pettegre) and [Tore Stensaker Tefre](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/torestef) as part of a master thesis project supervised by [George Adrian Stoica](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/stoica) at [The Department of Computer Science (IDI)](https://www.ntnu.edu/idi) at [The Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu) in Trondheim, Norway.
